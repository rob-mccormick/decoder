# Decoder

The Decoder was a free tool I built to help people identify and replace gendered words in job ads and job descriptions.

This was my first attempt to build my own web app. I knew python from taking the MIT open courses “Introduction to Computer Science and Programming” and “Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science,” so chose the Django web framework.

## Background
I read a research paper that found job ads and job descriptions often include gendered words that can put people off applying. The decoder was a free tool that helps people identify and replace gendered words.

## What it’s built with
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap

The app is relatively simple - it has two server rendered pages and a database to capture and process the submissions.

I created the design and experimented with different layouts and copy to make the value of the decoder clearer to people visiting the site. 

In the past it was hosted on Heroku, using a managed database. Being a small app, it ran well on the basic paid hobby dyno with a free database. It's no longer available since Heroku ended their free plan, but you can see a video of how it worked on [my portfolio site](https://robmc.dev/portfolio/decoder#see-it-in-action).
